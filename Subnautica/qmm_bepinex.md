## IMPORTANT: QMod Manager or BepInEx

There have been considerable changes to the Subnautica game code over the course of 2022. These changes have brought some great benefits, as well as adding some complexity to the modding eco-system. What is means to you as a modder is that you need to make a decision. This will determine some of the steps that follow in putting together your first mod.

Ask yourself this question:

1. > Do you want users of the “latest” version of Subnautica to play your mod?

If the answer is "yes", then you'll want to go down the BepInEx route. That's the only way to currently deploy mods to the latest "Living Large" version of the game. This has some caveats, the most significant of which is that the features of SML Helper are not yet available for mods using BepInEx. That may change in the future, however.

If the answer is “no”, or “don’t know”, or “not sure”, then you may need to ask yourself a follow up:

2. > Do you want or need the features of QMod Manager or SML Helper?

If the answer to that is “yes”, then you can go down the route of using QMod Manager and SML Helper to build your mod. Your mod won't, however, work with the latest "Living Large" version of the game. If the answer is "no", then you should definitely look to use BepInEx for your mod.

## But don't worry, we've got you!

Whichever route you take, we've got you covered! The examples in this guide cover both scenarios, across Subnautica and Subnautica: Below Zero. To make it as simple as possible, throughout the guide you’ll come across sections marked either ![](.\images\qmm.png) or ![](.\images\bepinex.png). Follow one or the other, but not both! The situation is fluid, and there are lots of cool things bubbling along in the background, so do come back to this guide, as you'll find the latest information that's to hand.
