# Checking in to GitHub

Well, mod created. Good work! If you took my advice and registered for an account on GitHub - good for you! You won't regret it! Now you've tested your first build, you can check your code into GitHub. This is easy in Visual Studio, or you can use GitHub Desktop.

In Visual Studio, right click your "Solution", not your Project, and select `Git \> Commit or Stash`. You can now commit your code and start to share and collaborate.

Well done!
