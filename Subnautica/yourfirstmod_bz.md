# Your first Subnautica: Below Zero mod

This is where it starts to get fun! Let create a mod that will double the damage of the knife. It's actually pretty straightforward to code, but the challenge with modding typically comes not from writing the code, but figuring out how to get the code hooked into the right place, and affecting the right objects and values in the game.

If you're stuck, or just need a bit of a nudge in the right direction, you can always refer to the working source code in my GitHub repository. Just make sure you're looking at the right project code:

Let's get our project set up, then we can take a look at how we find out how our mod is going to work.
