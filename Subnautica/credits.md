# Credits

Though I've written this guide, the hard work has been done by a community of amazing modders. I've named a few below, as helpful contributors to the scene, the tools and my efforts to build mods. It will be incomplete, but thank you to everyone for your help and support.

Thanks to, but not limited to:

-   PrimeSonic

-   Metious

-   tobeyStraitjacket

-   DaWrecka

-   Mikjaw

-   DarkOne

-   MrPurple6411

And to everyone else on the [Subnautica modding Discord](https://discord.gg/srQXTPKA).
