# Beginners Guide to Modding Subnautica and Subnautica: Below Zero

This guide is intended to give complete beginners a taste of how to go about creating mods for the Subnautica and Subnautica: Below Zero games. You'll learn everything from what software you require, how to install it and the basics of modding the Subnautica games. Within the guide you'll write you own mod, step by step, to set you up to build your own, bigger and better, mods.
