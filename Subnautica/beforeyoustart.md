# Before you begin

Coding and writing mods is fun! It's more fun with the support of a community of brilliant, helpful, fellow modders. This guide wouldn't have been possible without the help and support of this community. Supporting such a community is as much about giving and sharing as it is about receiving help and support.

Therefore, I would suggest you do two things before you begin:

-   **Get yourself onto the [Subnautica Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/UpWuWwq)** - lurk, get involved, learn, ask questions, it's all good!

-   **Set yourself up a repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/)** -- sharing and collaborating on code is one of the best ways to learn and improve. It's easy to do, just get yourself onto GitHub.com and register. We'll cover creating your first repository in the next section.

Finally, a few more pointers before we start:

1. There are two "your first mod" sections coming up, one for the original Subnautica game and one for Below Zero. Just be aware that the principals, process and concepts are identical for each game, but in many cases the classes, methods and attributes for what might seem like similar objects may be very different. You'll see this first hand as we attempt to mod the knife that's in both games.

2. Where I refer to \<game>, this is the folder in which your Subnautica game is installed. For example, for me, it's: 

   `C:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\SubnauticaZero`
   
   and
   
   `C:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Subnautica`
   
3. You can find the full source code for the sample mods in [this repository on GitHub](https://github.com/mroshaw/BeginnersGuideModSubnautica).

So, choose your path, is it going to be the original Subnautica or Below Zero? Take your pick, and let's code us a mod!
