# Welcome modders!

These pages house tutorials and guides for modders and Unity developers. Currently, you'll find a guide to modding the Subnautica and Subnautica: Below Zero games.

# Introduction

I love writing code. I've written code since I was a kid, and that was quite a long (long, long) time ago. I don't code in my job, so it's a challenge to find time to mess around with the new tools and languages that are so prevalent. In the past, I've used Visual Studio and C# to write some tools to help me with my day job, so I'm aware of the language and vaguely aware of how it all works. Like many, I'm "self-taught" and rely on forums, websites and communities to help me with my hobby.

I also love games. I've played games since I was a kid, and that... you get the idea. My first "gaming" machine was a ZX81, then a ZX Spectrum, moving onto to a Commodore Amiga. I bought, and still own, an original PlayStation. Zip through (a lot of) time to now, and I play PS5 and Nintendo Switch with my kids. I've never been a PC gamer, and never really saw the attraction. Then I decided to build myself a "work computer". I set a budget of £500. I spent hours on pcpartpicker.com and ended up spending nearly £2K on a beautiful build with an RTX2070 GPU. So what could I do? Couldn't let that go to waste! I installed Steam, and here I am, playing Subnautica and Below Zero in glorious resolution and in VR.

It was during my foray into Subnautica VR that I came across a splendid bunch of people in a Discord server that was dedicated to modding Subnautica games. I put two and two together, dusted off a fresh copy of Visual Studio, and set to. Modding is fun! It's challenging, it's open, it's creative and it's supported by brilliant communities. And so, I've written this guide, hopefully to help others who want to get involved, have fun, and themselves contribute to the growing community.

I hope you like it!
